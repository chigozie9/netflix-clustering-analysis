# Netflix User Segmentation with Clustering

This project applies unsupervised learning to uncover meaningful viewer segments using Netflix rating data. Using k-means clustering and Python visualization libraries, we identify distinct user behavior profiles that can help streaming platforms optimize recommendations and reduce churn.

## 📊 Insights

- **Cluster 1**: High-frequency raters with consistently high scores — likely loyal users  
- **Cluster 2**: Low average ratings — possibly critics or picky watchers  
- **Cluster 3**: Moderate, balanced users  
- **Cluster 0**: Inconsistent but active — likely exploratory or binge-watchers
