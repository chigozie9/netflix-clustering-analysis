# 🎬 Netflix User Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

This project explores how we can segment Netflix-style users based on their viewing and rating behavior.
We use unsupervised learning techniques (K-Means and PCA) to uncover distinct audience groups from the MovieLens 100K dataset — a popular proxy for streaming behavior.

## 🧠 Tools & Techniques

- **Pandas** for data wrangling
- **Scikit-learn** for K-Means clustering & PCA
- **Matplotlib** for visualizations
- **StandardScaler** for normalization

## 🧩 PCA Projection of User Clusters

We used K-Means clustering on normalized user behavior (e.g., avg rating, rating frequency, rating consistency).
PCA was applied to reduce dimensions and visualize user segments.

## 📊 Cluster Distribution

Here's the number of users that fell into each cluster group:

## ⭐ Average Rating by Cluster

Some clusters tend to rate movies more positively than others.
This view reveals behavioral differences between user types.

## 🔍 Insights

- **Cluster 1** contains high-frequency raters with consistently high ratings — likely loyal or engaged users
- **Cluster 2** includes viewers with low average ratings — possibly critics or picky watchers
- **Cluster 3** has moderate activity and average rating variance — casual or balanced users
- **Cluster 0** users are active but inconsistent — might reflect binge-watchers or exploratory viewers

These segments can help streaming platforms personalize recommendations, manage churn risk, or optimize engagement strategies.

## 🧾 Summary

This project demonstrates how clustering can uncover meaningful user segments from real viewing data.
Streaming platforms can use these insights to improve personalization, understand viewer behavior, and enhance user retention.
